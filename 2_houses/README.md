This repository contains my personal notes, experiments, and projects inspired by the book  
**_Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow_** by *Aurélien Géron*.  

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** — combining theoretical understanding with hands-on coding practice.
